App Description
weightTrack.js is an application that allows multiple users to 
input their height, weight, and date that they were measured. 
Then the users can review all weights they have ever entered 
and additionally see only the weights they entered over a specified 
timeline.

This application utilized the Body Mass Index Calculator API from 
Principal APIs to give the users their Body Mass Index based
on their specified measurements.
